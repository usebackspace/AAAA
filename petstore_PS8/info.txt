petstore - Phase 8

1. A. To choose particular address that we want to deliver for that we will add radio button to the address.

   B. We will put address detail inside form tag and put method="POST" so that when we click proceed to payment button.
      As Form is submitted we will send name="selected_address"  to the payment() and fetch the data through, 
        if request.method == 'POST':
            selected_address_id = request.POST.get('selected_address')

3. We will create payment() function and payment url and payment.html page, render paypal payment on payment.html

    <div class="row">
        {{paypal.render}}

    </div>


4. After Payment is done it will redirect to the payment_success.html

    def order(request):
        ord=Order.objects.filter(user=request.user)
        return render(request,'core/order.html',{'ord':ord})
