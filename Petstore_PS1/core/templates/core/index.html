            <p class="lead">Cats are known for their independent nature. They
                often groom themselves, and some may prefer solitude.
                They are territorial animals and may mark their territory with
                scent glands on their face.Cats communicate through
                vocalizations (meowing, purring), body language (tail movements,
                ear positions), and scent marking.
                Purring is often associated with contentment, but cats may also
                purr when stressed or in pain.Cats are generally clean animals
                and groom themselves by licking their fur.
                Regular veterinary care, vaccinations, and dental care are
                important for their overall health.</p>

            <p class="lead">Birds have beaks adapted to their feeding habits,
                including diverse shapes for catching prey, probing for insects,
                or cracking seeds.
                Their body structures are adapted for specific environments,
                enabling them to thrive in various ecosystems.
                Birds lay eggs, typically with hard shells, and engage in
                diverse reproductive behaviors.
                Parental care varies among species, with some birds exhibiting
                elaborate courtship rituals and others providing extensive care
                for their chick.Many birds are known for their songs, which are
                used for communication, territory marking, and attracting mates.
                Vocalizations vary widely among species, from the melodic songs
                of songbirds to the complex mimicry of parrots.</p>
